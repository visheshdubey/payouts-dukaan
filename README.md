This project was created as an assignment for [Dukaan.io](https://dukaan.io/).

### Prerequisites:

1. **Node.js & NPM/Yarn**: Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine with NPM (Node Package Manager) or Yarn.

### Steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository containing your Vite React TypeScript project using Git.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/visheshdubey/payouts-dukaan.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to Project Directory**: Move into the project directory.

   ```bash
   cd payouts-dukaan
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: Use npm or Yarn to install project dependencies.

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn
   ```

4. **Start the Development Server**: Run the command to start the development server.

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

5. **Access the Application**: Once the development server starts successfully, access the application in your browser using the provided URL (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

6. **Additional Commands**:

   - `npm run build` or `yarn build`: Builds the project for production.
   - `npm run serve` or `yarn serve`: Serves the production build locally for testing.

These steps will get your Vite React TypeScript project up and running locally, allowing you to start developing your application. Adjust the commands as needed based on your project's specific setup and scripts defined in the `package.json` file.
